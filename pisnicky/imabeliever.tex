\section{I'm a Believer}
I \ch{G}thought love was \ch{D}only true in \ch{G}fairy tales\\
Meant for someone \ch{D}else but not for \ch{G}me\\
\ch{C}Love was out to\ch{G} get me\\
\ch{C}That's the way it \ch{G}seemed\\
\ch{C}Disappointment \ch{G}haunted all of my \ch{D}dreams\\
\\
Then I saw her \ch{G}face\ch{C}, \ch{G}now \ch{C}I'm a be\ch{G}liev\ch{C}er\ch{G}\\
\ch{C}Not a \ch{G}tra\ch{C}ce\ch{G} of \ch{C}doubt in my \ch{G}mi\ch{C}nd\ch{G}\\
\ch{C}I'm in \ch{G}love\\
\ch{C}I'm a be\ch{G}liever, I couldn't \ch{F}leave her if I \ch{D}tried\\
\\
I thought love was more or less a giving thing\\
Seems the more I gave the less I got\\
What's the use in tryin'\\
All you get is pain?\\
When I needed sunshine, I got rain\\
\\
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer\\
Not a trace of doubt in my mind\\
I'm in love\\
I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried\\
\\
Oh\\
\\
Oh, love was out to get me\\
Now, that's the way it seemed\\
Disappointment haunted all of my dreams\\
\\
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer\\
Not a trace of doubt in my mind\\
I'm in love\\
I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried\\
\\
Yes, I saw her face, now I'm a believer\\
Not a trace of doubt in my mind\\
Said, I'm a believer, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (I'm a believer)\\
Said, I'm a believer, yeah (I'm a believer)\\
I said, I'm a believer, yeah (I'm a believer)\\
