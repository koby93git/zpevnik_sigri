\ch{E}There used to be a greying \ch{C}tower \ch{D}alone on the \ch{E}sea\\
You became the \ch{C}light on the \ch{D}dark side of \ch{E}me\\
Love remained a \ch{D}drug that's the \ch{A}high and not the \ch{E}pill\\
But did you know that when it \ch{Emi}snowed\\
My \ch{C}eyes become \ch{D}large and the \ch{C}light that you \ch{D}shine can be \ch{E}seen?\\
\\
Ba\ch{E}by, I compare you to a \ch{C}kiss from a \ch{D}rose on the \ch{E}grey\\
Ooh, the more I get of you, the \ch{C}stranger it \ch{D}feels, \ch{E}yeah\\
Now that your \ch{C}rose is in \ch{D}bloom\\
A \ch{C}light hits the \ch{D}gloom on the \ch{E}grey\\

There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say\\
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain\\
Baby, to \ch{C}me, you're like a growing \ch{D}addiction that I can't de\ch{E}ny\\
Won't you tell me, is that \ch{C}healthy, baby\ch{D}?\\
But did you \ch{E}know that when it \ch{Emi}snowed\\
My \ch{C}eyes become \ch{D}large and the \ch{C}light that you \ch{D}shine can be \ch{E}seen?\\
\\
Baby, I compare you to...\\

\ch{D}I've been \ch{A}kissed by a \ch{G}rose on the \ch{D}grey\\
I've been kissed by a rose on the grey\\
And if I should fall, will it all go away?\\
I've been kissed by a rose on the \ch{E}grey\\
\\
There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say\\
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain\\
To me, you're like a growing, addiction that I can't deny\\
Won't you tell me, is that healthy, baby?\\
But did you know that when it snowed\\
My eyes become large, and the light that you shine can be seen?\\
\\
Baby, I compare you to... 2x\\
