So you face it with a smile\\
There is no need to cry\\
For a trifle's more than this\\
\\
Would you still recall my name?\\
And the month it all began?\\
Will you release me with a kiss?\\
\\
Have I tried to draw the veil?\\
If I have, how could I fail?\\
Did I fear the consequence?\\
\\
\ch{C}Dazed by careless \ch{Dmi}words\\
Cozy in my mi\ch{A\be  B\be  C}nd\\
\\
/:I don't mind\\
I think so\\
I will let you go:/\\

Now you shaped that liquid wax\\
Fit it out with crater cracks\\
Sweet devotion my delight\\
\\
Oh, you're such a pretty one\\
And the naked thrills of flesh and skin\\
Would tease me through the night\\
\\
Now I hate to leave you bare\\
If you need me I'll be there\\
Don't you ever let me down\\
\\
Dazed by careless words\\
Cozy in my mind\\
\\
I don't mind...\\

\\
\ch{C}And I touched your \ch{Dmi}face\\
Narcotic mind from \ch{F}laced Mary-\ch{C}Jane\ch{G}\\
\\
\ch{C}And I called your name\\
Like an addicted to cocaine\\
Calls for the stuff he'd rather blame\\
\\
And I touched your face\\
Narcotic mind from laced Mary-Jane\\
\\
\ch{C}And I called your \ch{Dmi}name\\
My co\ch{F}caine\\
\\
\ch{C}I don't mind... 2x\\
