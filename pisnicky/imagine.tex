\section{Imagine}
\ch{C}Imagine there's no \ch{F}heaven\\
It's easy if you try\\
No hell below us\\
Above us only sky\\
\ch{F}Imagine \ch{Ami}all the \ch{Dmi\7}people\\
\ch{G}Living for \ch{G\7}today...\\
\\
Imagine there's no countries\\
It isn't hard to do\\
Nothing to kill or die for\\
And no religion too\\
Imagine all the people\\
Living life in peace...\\
\\
\ch{F}You may \ch{G}say I'm a \ch{C}dreamer\ch{E\7}\\
But I'm not the only one\\
I hope someday you'll join us\\
\ch{F}And the \ch{G}world will \ch{C}be as one\\
\\
Imagine no possessions\\
I wonder if you can\\
No need for greed or hunger\\
A brotherhood of man\\
Imagine all the people\\
Sharing all the world...\\
\\
You may say I'm a dreamer\\
But I'm not the only one\\
I hope someday you'll join us\\
And the world will live as one...\\
