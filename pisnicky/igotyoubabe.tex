\ch{H}They say we're young and \ch{E}we don't know\\
We \ch{H}won't find out un \ch{E}til\ch{A} we \ch{F\kr}grow\\
\color{blue}
Well I don't know if all that's true\\
'Cause you got me, and baby I got you\\
\ch{H}Babe, \color{black}\ch{E}I got \ch{H}you babe (2x)\\
\\
\color{red}
They say our love won't pay the rent\\
Before it's earned, our money's all been spent\\
\color{blue}
I guess that's so, we don't have a plot\\
But at least I'm sure of all the things we got\\
Babe, \color{black}I got you babe (2x)\\
\\
\color{blue}
I got \ch{C\kr m\7}flowers in the \ch{F\kr}spring\\
I got you to wear my ring\\
\color{red}
And when I'm {\ch{H}sad, you're a \ch{E}clown\\
And if I get scared, you're always \ch{F\kr}around\ch{G}\\
\\
So \ch{C}let them say your \ch{F}hair's too long\\
'Cause \ch{C}I don't care, with \ch{F}you I \ch{B\be}}can't go \ch{G}wrong\\
\color{blue}
Then put your little hand in mine\\
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb\\
\ch{C}Babe, \color{black}\ch{F}I got \ch{C}you babe (2x)\\
\\
\color{blue} \ch{C}I got you to \ch{F}hold my hand\\
\color{red} \ch{C}I got you to \ch{G}understand\\
\color{blue} I got you to walk with me\\
\color{red} I got you to talk with me\\
\color{blue} I got you to kiss goodnight\\
\color{red} I got you to hold me tight\\
\color{blue} I got you, I won't let go\\
\color{red} I got you to love me so\\
