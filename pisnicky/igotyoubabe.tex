\section{I Got You Babe}
\color{red}\textcolor{black}{\ch{H}}They say we're young and \textcolor{black}{\ch{E}}we don't know\\
We \textcolor{black}{\ch{H}}won't find out un \textcolor{black}{\ch{E}}til\textcolor{black}{\ch{A}} we \textcolor{black}{\ch{F\kr}}grow\\
\color{blue}
Well I don't know if all that's true\\
'Cause you got me, and baby I got you\\
\textcolor{black}{\ch{H}}Babe, \color{black}\ch{E}I got \ch{H}you babe (2x)\\
\\
\color{red}
They say our love won't pay the rent\\
Before it's earned, our money's all been spent\\
\color{blue}
I guess that's so, we don't have a plot\\
But at least I'm sure of all the things we got\\
Babe, \color{black}I got you babe (2x)\\
\\
\color{blue}
I got \textcolor{black}{\ch{C\kr m\7}}flowers in the \textcolor{black}{\ch{F\kr}}spring\\
I got you to wear my ring\\
\color{red}
And when I'm \textcolor{black}{\ch{H}}sad, you're a \textcolor{black}{\ch{E}}clown\\
And if I get scared, you're always \textcolor{black}{\ch{F\kr}}around\textcolor{black}{\ch{G}}\\
\\
So \textcolor{black}{\ch{C}}let them say your \textcolor{black}{\ch{F}}hair's too long\\
'Cause \textcolor{black}{\ch{C}}I don't care, with \textcolor{black}{\ch{F}}you I \textcolor{black}{\ch{B\be}}can't go \textcolor{black}{\ch{G}}wrong\\
\color{blue}
Then put your little hand in mine\\
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb\\
\textcolor{black}{\ch{C}}Babe, \color{black}\ch{F}I got \ch{C}you babe (2x)\\
\\
\color{blue} \textcolor{black}{\ch{C}}I got you to \textcolor{black}{\ch{F}}hold my hand\\
\color{red} \textcolor{black}{\ch{C}}I got you to \textcolor{black}{\ch{G}}understand\\
\color{blue} I got you to walk with me\\
\color{red} I got you to talk with me\\
\color{blue} I got you to kiss goodnight\\
\color{red} I got you to hold me tight\\
\color{blue} I got you, I won't let go\\
\color{red} I got you to love me so\\
\\ \color{black}
I \ch{F}got  you \ch{C}babe\\
\\
I got you babe...
