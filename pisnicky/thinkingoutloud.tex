\section{Thinking Out Loud}
\ch{A}When \ch{A/C\kr}your legs don't work like they \ch{D}used to before\ch{E}\\
And I can't sweep you off of your feet\\
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love\\
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks\\
\\
And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70\\
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23\\
And I'm thinking 'bout how \ch{Hmi}people fall in love in mys\ch{E}terious \ch{A}ways\\
\ch{Hmi}Maybe just the touch of a \ch{E}hand\\
Oh \ch{Hmi}me I fall in love with you e\ch{E}very single \ch{F\kr mi}day\\
And \ch{Hmi}I just wanna tell you I \ch{E}am\\
\\
So honey now\ch{A  A/C\kr}\\
\ch{D}Take \ch{E}me into your loving arms\\
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars\\
Place your head on my beating heart\\
I'm thinking out loud\\
Maybe \ch{F\kr mi}we \ch{E}found \ch{D}love \ch{A/C\kr}right \ch{Hmi}where \ch{E}we \ch{A}are\\
\\
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades\\
And the crowds don't remember my name\\
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm\\
I know you will still love me the same\\
\\
'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen\\
Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory\\
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways\\
Maybe it's all part of a plan\\
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes\\
Hoping that you'll understand\\
\\
But baby now\\
Take me into...\\
\\
So baby now\\
Take me into...\\
