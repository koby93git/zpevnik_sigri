\section{Hallelujah}
\ch{C}Now I've heard there was a \ch{Ami}secret chord\\
That David played, and it pleased the Lord\\
But \ch{F}you don't really \ch{G}care for music, \ch{C}do you?\ch{G}\\
Well, \ch{C}it goes like this\\
The \ch{F}fourth, the \ch{G}fifth\\
The \ch{Ami}minor fall, the \ch{F}major lift\\
The \ch{G}baffled king \ch{E\7}composing Halle\ch{Ami}lujah\\
Hallelujah...
\\
Your faith was strong but you needed proof\\
You saw her bathing on the roof\\
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you\\
She tied you\\
To a kitchen chair\\
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair\\
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah\\

Halle\ch{F}lujah, halle\ch{Ami}lujah, halle\ch{F}lujah, halle\ch{C G}lu  \ch{C}jah
\\
Baby I've been here before\\
I've known this room and I've walked this floor\\
I used to live alone before I knew ya\\
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch\\
And love is not a vict'ry march\\
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah\\
Hallelujah, ...\\
\\
There was a time that you let me now\\
What's really going on bellow\\
But now you never show it to me, do you?\\
And remember when I moved in you\\
The holy dove she was moving too\\
And every single breath that we drew was Hallelujah\\
Hallelujah, ...\\
\\
Well, maybe there’s a God above\\
But all I’ve ever learned from love\\
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya\\
And it’s not a cry that you hear at night\\
It’s not somebody who's seen the light\\
It’s a cold and it’s a broken Hallelujah\\
Hallelujah, ...
