\ch{F}I thought I saw a man brought to life\ch{Ami}\\
He was warm, he came around like he was \ch{B\be}dignified\\
He showed me what it was to cry\\
Well, you couldn't be that man I adored\\
You don't seem to know, or seem to care what your heart is for\\
But I don't know him anymore\\
\\
There's \ch{Dmi}nothin' where he used to lie\\
\ch{C}The conversation has run dry\\
\ch{Ami}That's what's goin' on\\
\ch{C}Nothing's fine, I'm \ch{F}torn\\
\\
\ch{F}I'm all out of \ch{C}faith, this is how I \ch{Dmi}feel\\
I'm cold and I am \ch{B\be}shamed lying naked on the \ch{F}floor\\
Illusion never changed into something real\\
I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn\\
You're a little late, I'm already torn\\
\\
So I guess the fortune teller's right\\
Should've seen just what was there and not some holy light\\
But you crawled beneath my veins and now\\
\\
I don't care, I had no luck\\
I don't miss it all that much\\
There's just so many things\\
That I can touch, I'm torn\\
\\
I'm all out of faith...\\

There's nothing where he used to lie\\
My inspiration has run dry\\
And that's what's goin' on\\
Nothing's right, I'm torn\\
\\
I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel\\
I'm cold and I am shamed lying naked on the floor\\
Illusion never changed into something real\\
I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn\\
I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel\\
I'm cold and I'm ashamed bound and broken on the floor\\
You're a little late, I'm already torn\\
