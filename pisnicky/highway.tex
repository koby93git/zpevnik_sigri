\section{Highway to Hell}
\ch{A}Livin' easy, \ch{D G}lovin' free\\
\ch{D G}Season \ch{D G}ticket on a one \ch{D A}way ride\\
Askin' nothin', leave me be\\
Takin' everythin' in my stride\\
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme\\
Ain't nothin' that I'd rather do\\
Goin' down, party time\\
My friends are gonna \ch{E}be there too\\
\\
I'm on the \ch{A}highway to \ch{D}hell\ch{G D}\\
On the highway to hell\\
Highway to hell\\
I'm on the highway to \ch{D}hell\\
\\
No stop signs speed limit\\
Nobody's gonna slow me down\\
Like a wheel gonna spin it\\
Nobody's gonna mess me around\\
Hey, Satan, paid my dues\\
Playin' in a rockin' band\\
Hey, mamma, look at me\\
I'm on the way to the promised land\\
\\
I'm on the highway to hell\\
Highway....
\\
\ch{D}Don't stop me\\
Hey, hey...\\
\\
I'm on the highway ....\\
\\
\ch{D}And I'm goin' down\\
All the way\ch{A}\\
I'm on the highway to hell\\
