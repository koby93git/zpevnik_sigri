\section{The Best}
\ch{E}I call you when I need you, my heart's on fire\\
You come to me, come to me wild and wild\\
When you come to \ch{C\kr mi}me\\
Give me everything \ch{A}I need\\
\\
\ch{E}Give me a lifetime of promises and a world of dreams\\
Speak a language of love like you know what it means\\
Mmm, and it can't be \ch{C\kr mi}wrong\\
Take my heart and make it \ch{A}strong, baby \ch{H}\\
\\
You're simply the \ch{E}best\\
Better than all the rest\\
Better than \ch{C\kr mi}anyone\\
Anyone I've \ch{H}ever met\\
I'm stuck on your heart\\
I hang on every word you say\\
Tear us apart\\
Baby, I would rather be dead\\
\\
In your heart, I see the star of every night and every day\\
In your eyes, I get lost, I get washed away\\
Just as long as I'm here in your arms\\
I could be in no better place\\
\\
You're simply the best...

\ch{A}Each time you leave me, I start losing control\\
You're \ch{C\kr mi}walking away with my heart and my soul\\
\ch{A}I can feel you even when I'm alone\\
\ch{H}Oh baby, don't let \ch{C\kr}go\\
\\
SOLO\\

Ooh, you're the \ch{F\kr}best, ooh\\
Better than all the rest\\
Better than \ch{D\kr mi}anyone\\
Anyone I've \ch{C\kr}ever met\\
I'm stuck on your heart\\
I hang on every word you say\\
Tear us apart\\
Baby, I would rather be dead\\
\\
You're the best!\\
