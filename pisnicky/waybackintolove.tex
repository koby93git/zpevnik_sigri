\ch{B\be}I've been living with a \ch{Gmi}shadow over\ch{B\be}head\\
I've been sleeping with a \ch{Gmi}cloud above my \ch{Cmi}bed\\
I've been lonely for \ch{F}so long\\
\ch{Cmi}Trapped in the past, I just can't \ch{F} seem to move on\\
\\
\color{blue}
I've been hiding all my hopes and dreams away\\
Just in case I ever need them again someday\\
I've been setting aside time\\
To clear a little space in the corners of my mind\\
\\

\ch{B\be}All I want to \ch{Gmi}do is find a \ch{E\be}way back into \ch{B\be}love\\
\ch{B\be}I can't make it \ch{Gmi}through without a \ch{E\be}way back into \ch{B\be}love\\
Oh oh \ch{F}oh\\
\\
\color{red}
I've been watching but the stars refuse to shine\\
I've been searching but I just don't see the signs\\
I know that it's out there\\
There's got to be something for my soul somewhere\\
\\
\color{blue}
I've been looking for someone to shed some light\\
Not somebody just to get me through the night\\
I could use some direction\\
And I'm open to your suggestions\\
\\
\color{black}
All I want to do is find a way back into love\\
I can't make it through without a way back into love\\
And if I \ch{F}open my heart again\\
I guess I'm hoping you'll be there for me in the \ch{B\be}end\\
\\
MEZIHRA (jako začátek)\\

There are moments when I don't know if it's real\\
Or if anybody feels the way I feel\\
I need inspiration\\
Not just another negotiation\\
\\
\\
\color{black}
All I want to do is find a way back into love\\
I can't make it through without a way back into love\\
And if I \ch{F}open my heart to you\\
I'm hoping \ch{Gmi}you'll show me what to do\\
And if you \ch{Cmi}help me to start again\\
You \ch{F}know that I'll be there for you in the \ch{B\be}end\\
