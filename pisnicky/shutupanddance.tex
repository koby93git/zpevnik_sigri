We were victims of the night\\
The chemical, physical, kryptonite\\
Helpless to the bass and the fading light\\
Oh we were bound to get together\\
Bound to get together\\

\ch{F/e}She took \ch{F}my arm\\
\ch{C}I don't \ch{C/h}know how \ch{G}it happ\ch{F}ened\\
\ch{F/e}We took \ch{F}the floor and she \ch{G}said\\
\\
Oh don't you dare look back...\\

A backless dress and some beat up sneaks\\
My discotheque Juliet teenage dream\\
I felt it in my chest as she looked at me\\
I knew we were bound to be together\\
Bound to be together\\
\\
She took my arm...\\
\\
Oh don't you dare look back...\\
\\
\ch{F}Oh, c'mon girl\\

\ch{F/e}Deep in \ch{F}her eyes\\
\ch{C}I think \ch{C/h}I see \ch{G}the fu\ch{F}ture\\
\ch{F/e}I re\ch{F}alize \ch{C}this is \ch{C/h}my \ch{G}last chance\\
She took my arm\\
I don't know how it happened\\
We took the floor and she said\\
\\
Oh don't you dare look back...\\
\\
Don't you dare look back...\\

Oh oh oh shut up dance with me\\
