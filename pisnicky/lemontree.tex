\section{Lemon Tree}
\ch{Dmi}I'm sitting here in a \ch{Ami}boring room\\
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon\\
I'm wasting my time, I've got nothing to do\\
I'm hanging around, I'm waiting for you\\
But \ch{Gmi}nothing ever happens, \ch{Ami}and I \ch{Dmi}wonder\\
\\
I'm driving around in my car\\
I'm driving too fast I'm driving too far\\
I'd like to change my point of view\\
I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you\\
But nothing ever happens, and I wonder\\
\\
I \ch{F}wonder how, I \ch{C}wonder why\\
\ch{Dmi}Yesterday you told me 'bout the \ch{Ami}blue blue sky\\
And \ch{B\be}all that I can \ch{C}see is just a yellow \ch{F}lemon tree\ch{C}\\
I'm turning my head up and down\\
I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around\\
And \ch{B\be}all that I can \ch{G\7}see is just another \ch{C}lemon tree \ch{C\7 Dmi}  dam pa di da\\
\\
I'm sitting here, I miss the power\\
I'd like to go out, taking a shower\\
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head\\
I feel so tired, I put myself into bed\\
well nothing ever happens, and I wonder\\
\\
\ch{A}Isolation, is \ch{Dmi}not good for me\\
\ch{C}Isolation, \ch{F}I don't want to \ch{A}sit on a lemon tree\\
\\
I'm stepping around in a desert of joy\\
Maybe anyhow I'll get another toy\\
And everything will happen, and you'll wonder\\
\\
I wonder how, I wonder why\\
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky\\
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree\\
I'm turning my head up and down\\
I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around\\
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree\\
\\
And I wonder, wonder, I wonder how I wonder why\\
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky\\
And \ch{B\be}all that I can \ch{C}see \\
And \ch{B\be}all that I can \ch{C}see (dit dit dit)\\
And \ch{B\be}all that I can \ch{C}see is just a yellow \ch{F}lemon tree\\
