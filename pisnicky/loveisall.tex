\section{Love Is All Around}
I \ch{G}feel it in my \ch{Ami}fingers\\
\ch{C}I feel it \ch{D}in my \ch{G}toes\\
The love that's all around me\\
And so the feeling grows\\
It's written on the wind\\
It's everywhere I go\\
So if you really love me\\
Come on and let it show\\
\\
\ch{C}You know I love you, I \ch{Ami}always will\\
\ch{C}My mind's made up by the \ch{G}way that I feel\\
There's \ch{C}no beginning, there'll \ch{Ami}be no end\\
'Cause \ch{A\7}on my love you \ch{D}can depend\\
\\
I see your face before me\\
As I lay on my bed\\
I cannot get to thinking\\
Of all the things you said\\
You gave your promise to me\\
and I gave mine to you\\
I need someone beside me\\
in everything I do\\
\\
You know I love you, I always will\\
My mind's made up by the way that I feel\\
There's no beginning, there'll be no end\\
'Cause on my love you can depend\\
\\
I feel it in my fingers\\
I feel it in my toes\\
The love that's all around me\\
And so the feeling grows\\
It's written in the wind\\
Oh everywhere I go\\
So if you really love me,\\
Come on and let it show\\
Come on and let it show.....\\
