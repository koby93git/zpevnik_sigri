\section{All of Me (Legend)}
\ch{Dmi}What would I \ch{B\be}do without your smart \ch{F}mouth\\
Drawing me \ch{C}in, and you kicking me \ch{Dmi}out\\
Got my head spinning, no kidding,\\
I can’t pin you down\\
What’s going on in that beautiful mind\\
I’m on your magical mystery ride\\
And I’m so dizzy, don’t know what hit me,\\
but I’ll be al\ch{Gmi}ight\\
\\
\ch{Gmi}My head’s under \ch{F}water\\
But \ch{C}I’m breathing \ch{Gmi}fine\\
You’re crazy and \ch{F}I’m out of my \ch{C}mind\\
\\
'Cause \ch{F}all of me\\
Loves \ch{Dmi}all of you\\
Love your \ch{Gmi}curves and all your edges\\
All your \ch{C}perfect imperfections\\
Give your all to me\\
I’ll give my all to you\\
You’re my end and my beginning\\
Even when I lose I’m winning\\
'Cause I give you \ch{Dmi}all, \ch{B\be}all of \ch{F}me \ch{C}\\
And you give me all, all of you\\
\begin{multicols}{2}
How many times do I have to tell you\\
Even when you’re crying you’re beautiful too\\
The world is beating you down,\\
I’m around through every move\\
You’re my downfall, you’re my muse\\
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues\\
I can’t stop singing, it’s ringing,\\
in my head for you\\
\\
My head’s under water...\\
\\
'Cause all of me...\\
\columnbreak
\\
Give me all of \ch{Gmi}you\\
Cards on the \ch{F}table, we’re \ch{C}both showing \ch{Gmi}hearts\\
Risking it \ch{F}all, though it’s \ch{C}hard\\
\\
'Cause all of me...\\
\\
I give you all, all of me\\
And you give me all, all of you\\
