\section{Behind Blue Eyes}
\ch{Emi}No one knows what it's \ch{G\6}like\\
To be the \ch{Dsus2}bad man\\
To be the \ch{Csus2}sad man\\
Be\ch{Asus2}hind blue eyes\\
And no one knows what it's like\\
To be hated\\
To be faded\\
To telling only lies\\
\\
But my \ch{C}dream\ch{D}s they aren't as \ch{G}empty\\
As my \ch{C}conscience \ch{D}seems to \ch{E}be\\
I have \ch{Hmi}hours, only \ch{C}lonely\\
My love is \ch{D}vengeance\\
That's never \ch{Asus2}free\\
\\
No one knows what its like\\
To feel these feelings\\
Like I do\\
And I blame you\\
No one bites back as hard\\
On their anger\\
None of my pain and woe\\
Can show through\\
\\
But my dreams...\\
\\
No one knows what its like\\
To be mistreated\\
to be defeated\\
Behind blue eyes\\
An no one know how to say\\
That they're sorry and don't worry\\
I'm not telling lies\\
But my dreams...\\
\\
No one knows what its like\\
To be the bad man\\
To be the sad man\\
Behind blue eyes
