We get it \ch{Emi}almost every night\\
\ch{A}When that ol' \ch{D}moon gets-a \ch{D/c\kr}big and \ch{Hmi}bright\\
It's a supernatural delight\\
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight\\
\\
Everybody here is out of sight\\
They don't bark, and they don't bite\\
They keep things loose, they keep things light\\
Everybody was dancin' in the moonlight\\
\\
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight\\
Everybody's feelin' warm and right\\
It's such a fine and natural sight\\
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight\\
\\
We like our fun and we never fight\\
You can't dance and stay uptight\\
It's a supernatural delight\\
Everybody was dancin' in the moonlight\\
\\
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight\\
Everybody's feelin' warm and right\\
It's such a fine and natural sight\\
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight\\
