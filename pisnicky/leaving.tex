\section{Leaving on a Jet Plane}
All my \ch{D}bags are packed I'm \ch{G}ready to go\\
I'm standin' here outside your door\\
I \ch{D}hate to wake you \ch{Hmi}up to say good\ch{A}bye\\
But the dawn is breakin' it's early morn\\
The taxi's waitin' he's blowin' his horn\\
Already I'm so lonesome I could die\\
\\
So kiss me and smile for me\\
Tell me that you'll wait for me\\
Hold me like you'll never let me go\\
Cause I'm leavin' on a jet plane\\
Don't know when I'll be back again\\
Oh baby, I hate to go\\
\\
There's so many times I've let you down\\
So many times I've played around\\
I tell you now, they don't mean a thing\\
Every place I go, I'll think of you\\
Every song I sing, I'll sing for you\\
When I come back, I'll bring your wedding ring\\
\\
So kiss me...\\
\\
Now the time has come to leave you\\
One more time let me kiss you\\
Close your eyes I'll be on my way\\
Dream about the days to come\\
When I won't have to leave alone\\
About the times, I won't have to say\\
\\
So kiss me...\\
\\
Cause I'm leavin' on a jet plane\\
Don't know when I'll be back again\\
Oh baby, I hate to go \\
