\section{Get Lucky}
Like the legend of the \ch{Hmi}Phoenix\ch{D}\\
All ends with \ch{F\kr mi}beginnings\ch{E}\\
What keeps the planet spinning\\
The force from the beginning\\
\\
We've come too far\\
To give up who we are\\
So let's raise the bar\\
And our cups to the stars\\
\\
She's up all night to the sun\\
I'm up all night to get some\\
She's up all night for good fun\\
I'm up all night to get lucky\\
\\
We're up all night to the sun\\
We're up all night to get some\\
We're up all night for good fun\\
We're up all night to get lucky(5x)\\
\\
The present has no ribbon\\
Your gift keeps on giving\\
What is this I'm feeling?\\
If you want to leave, I'm with it\\
\\
We've come too far \\
To give up who we are\\
So let's raise the bar\\
And our cups to the stars\\
\\
She's up all night to the sun\\
I'm up all night to get some\\
She's up all night for good fun\\
I'm up all night to get lucky\\
\\
We're up all night to the sun\\
We're up all night to get some\\
We're up all night for good fun\\
We’re up all night to get lucky......\\
