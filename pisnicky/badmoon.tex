\section{Bad Moon Rising}
\ch{A}I see a \ch{E}bad \ch{D}moon \ch{A}a-rising\\
I see trouble on the way\\
I see earthquakes and lightnin'\\
I see bad times today\\
\\
\ch{D}Don't go 'round tonight\\
It's \ch{A}bound to take your life\\
\ch{E}There's a \ch{D}bad moon on the \ch{A}rise\\
\\
I hear hurricanes a-blowing\\
I know the end is coming soon\\
I fear rivers over flowing\\
I hear the voice of rage and ruin\\
\\
Don't go 'round tonight\\
It's bound to take your life\\
There's a bad moon on the rise\\
\\
I hope you got your things together\\
I hope you are quit prepared to die\\
Look's like we're in for nasty weather\\
One eye is taken for an eye\\
\\
Oh don't go 'round tonight\\
It's bound to take your life\\
There's a bad moon on the rise\\
There's a bad moon on the rise\\
