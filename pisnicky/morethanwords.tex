\section{More than Words}
\ch{G}Saying I \ch{C}love you\\
Is \ch{Ami}not the words I \ch{C}want to \ch{D\7}hear from you\\
\ch{G}It's not that I \ch{C}want you\\
\ch{Ami}Not to say, but \ch{C}if you on\ch{D\7}ly knew\\
\ch{Emi}How \ch{Ami}easy \ch{D\7}it would be to \ch{G}show me \ch{G/f\kr}how you \ch{Emi}feel \\
\\
More than \ch{Ami}words is \ch{D\7}all you have to \ch{G\7}do to make it re\ch{C}al \\
Then you \ch{Cmi}wouldn't have to \ch{G}say that \ch{G/f\kr}you \ch{Emi}love me \\
'Cause \ch{Ami}I'd al\ch{D\7}ready \ch{G}know \\
\\
\ch{G}What would you \ch{G/f\kr}do if my \ch{Emi}heart was \ch{Hmi}torn in \ch{C}two \\
More than words to show you \ch{Ami}feel \\
That your \ch{D\7}love for me is \ch{G}real \\
\ch{G}What would you \ch{G/f\kr}say if I \ch{Emi}took those \ch{Hmi}words a\ch{C}way \\
Then you couldn't make things \ch{Ami}new \\
Just by \ch{D\7}saying I love \ch{G}you\\
