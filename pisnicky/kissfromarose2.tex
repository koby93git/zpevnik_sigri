\ch{G}There used to be a greying \ch{E\be}tower \ch{F}alone on the \ch{G}sea\\
You became the \ch{E\be}light on the \ch{F}dark side of \ch{G}me\\
Love remained a \ch{F}drug that's the \ch{C}high and not the \ch{G}pill\\
But did you know that when it \ch{Gmi}snowed\\
My \ch{E\be}eyes become \ch{F}large and the \ch{E\be}light that you \ch{F}shine can be \ch{G}seen?\\
\\
Ba\ch{G}by, I compare you to a \ch{E\be}kiss from a \ch{F}rose on the \ch{G}grey\\
Ooh, the more I get of you, the \ch{E\be}stranger it \ch{F}feels, \ch{G}yeah\\
Now that your \ch{E\be}rose is in \ch{F}bloom\\
A \ch{E\be}light hits the \ch{F}gloom on the \ch{G}grey\\

There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say\\
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain\\
Baby, to \ch{E\be}me, you're like a growing \ch{F}addiction that I can't de\ch{G}ny\\
Won't you tell me, is that \ch{E\be}healthy, baby\ch{F}?\\
But did you \ch{G}know that when it \ch{Gmi}snowed\\
My \ch{E\be}eyes become \ch{F}large and the \ch{E\be}light that you \ch{F}shine can be \ch{G}seen?\\
\\
Baby, I compare you to...\\

\ch{F}I've been \ch{C}kissed by a \ch{B\be}rose on the \ch{F}grey\\
I've been kissed by a rose on the grey\\
And if I should fall, will it all go away?\\
I've been kissed by a rose on the \ch{G}grey\\
\\
There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say\\
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain\\
To me, you're like a growing, addiction that I can't deny\\
Won't you tell me, is that healthy, baby?\\
But did you know that when it snowed\\
My eyes become large, and the light that you shine can be seen?\\
\\
Baby, I compare you to... 2x\\
