It's been a \ch{G}hard \ch{C}day's night, and I'd been \ch{F}working like a dog\\
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log\\
But when I \ch{C}get home to you I find the \ch{D}things that you do\\
Will make me \ch{G}feel \ch{F}al\ch{G}right\\

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things\\
And it's worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me everything\\
So why on earth should I moan, cos when I get you alone\\
You know I feel OK\\

When I'm \ch{G}home \ch{Emi}feeling you holding me \ch{C}tight, \ch{D}tight, yeah\\
