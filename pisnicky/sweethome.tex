\section{Sweet Home Alabama}
\ch{D}Big \ch{C}wheels keep on \ch{G}turning\\
Carry me home to see my kin\\
Singing songs about the Southland\\
I miss Alabamy once again and I think it's a sin, yes\\
\\
MEZIHRA\\
\\
Well I heard mister Young sing about her\\
Well, I heard old Neil put her down\\
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember\\
A Southern man don't need him around anyhow\\
\\
\ch{D}Sweet \ch{C}home Ala\ch{G}bama\ch{C}\\
Where the skies are so blue\\
Sweet Home Alabama\\
Lord, I'm coming home to you\\

In Birmingham they love the governor (\ch{F}boo, \ch{C}boo, \ch{D}boo)\\
Now we all did what we could do\\
Now Watergate does not bother me\\
Does your conscience bother you? Tell the truth\\
\\
Sweet home Alabama...\\
\\
SOLO\\
\\
MEZIHRA\\
\\
Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers\\
And they've been known to pick a song or two\\
Lord they get me off so much\\
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue. Now how about you?\\

Sweet home Alabama...\\
