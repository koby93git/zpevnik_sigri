\section{Hungry Heart}
\ch{C}Got a wife and kids in \ch{Ami}Baltimore, Jack\\
I went \ch{Dmi\7}out for a ride and I \ch{G\7}never went back\\
Like a river that don't know where it's flowing\\
I took a wrong turn and I just kept going\\
\\
Everybody's got a hungry heart\\
Everybody's got a hungry heart\\
Lay down your money and you play your part\\
Everybody's got a hungry heart\\
\\
I met her in a Kingstown bar\\
We fell in love I knew it had to end\\
We took what we had and we ripped it apart\\
Now here I am down in Kingstown again\\
\\
Everybody's got a hungry heart\\
Everybody's got a hungry heart\\
Lay down your money and you play your part\\
Everybody's got a hungry heart\\

\ch{C}Everybody needs a \ch{Ami}place to rest\\
\ch{Dmi\7}Everybody wants to \ch{G\7}have a home\\
Don't make no difference what nobody says\\
Ain't nobody like to be alone\\
\\
Everybody's got a hungry heart\\
Everybody's got a hungry heart\\
Lay down your money and you play your part\\
Everybody's got a hungry heart\\

Everybody's got a hungry heart...\\
