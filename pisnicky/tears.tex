\section{Tears in Heaven}
Would you know my name\\
If I saw you in heaven?\\
Would it be the same\\
If I saw you in heaven?\\
I must be strong, and carry on\\
Cause I know I don't belong\\
Here in heaven\\
\\
Would you hold my hand\\
If I saw you in heaven?\\
Would you help me stand\\
If I saw you in heaven?\\
I'll find my way, through night and day\\
Cause I know I just can't stay\\
Here in heaven\\
\\
\ch{C}Time can \ch{G}bring you \ch{Ami}down\\
Time can \ch{D}bend your knee\ch{G D Emi D G}\\
Time can break your heart\\
Have you begging please\\
Begging \ch{E}please\\
\\
Beyond the door\\
There's peace I'm sure.\\
And I know there'll be no more...\\
Tears in heaven\\
\\
Would you know my name\\
If I saw you in heaven?\\
Would it be the same\\
If I saw you in heaven?\\
I must be strong, and carry on\\
Cause I know I don't belong\\
Here in heaven...\\
