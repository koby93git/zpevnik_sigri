\ch{C}You know, \ch{C/E}Baby, when you're \ch{F}in my \ch{G}arms,\\
I can feel your loving magic charms\\
You drive me crazy,\\
you drive me crazy.\\
\\
And when I'm looking in those big blue eyes,\\
I start a'floating round in paradise,\\
You drive me crazy,\\
you drive me crazy.\\
\\
\ch{F}Heaven must have sent you \ch{G}down,\\
\ch{F}Down for you to give me a \ch{G}thrill,\\
\ch{F}Every time you touch me\\
Every time you hold me,\\
My \ch{D}heart starts speeding like a \ch{G}train on a track.\\
\\
I love you, Baby, and it's plain to see,\\
I love you, honey, it was meant to be\\
You drive me crazy,\\
you drive me crazy, oh.\\
