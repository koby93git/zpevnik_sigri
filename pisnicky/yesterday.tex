\section{Yesterday}
\ch{F}Yesterday, \ch{Emi\7}all my \ch{A\7}troubles seemed so \ch{Dmi}far away,\\
\ch{B\be}Now it \ch{C\7}looks as thought they're \ch{F}here to stay,\\
Oh \ch{Dmi}I be\ch{G\7}lieve in \ch{B\be}ye\ch{F}sterday.\\
\\
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be\\
There's a shadow hanging over me,\\
Oh yesterday came suddenly.\\
\\
\ch{Emi\7}Why \ch{A\7}she \ch{Dmi}had \ch{(c)}to \ch{B\be}go,\\
I don't \ch{Gmi}know, she \ch{C}wouldn't \ch{F}say.\\
I said something wrong,\\
Now I long for yesterday.\\
\\
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play,\\
Now I need a place to hide away,\\
Oh I believe in yesterday.\\
\\
Why she had to go,\\
I don't know, she wouldn't say.\\
I said something wrong,\\
Now I long for yesterday.\\
\\
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play,\\
Now I need a place to hide away,\\
Oh I believe in yesterday.\\

\ch{F}Mmm...\ch{G\7 B\be  F}\\
