Tell me somethin', girl\\
Are you happy in this modern world?\\
Or do you need more?\\
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?\\
I'm falling\\
In all the good times I find myself\\
Longin' for change\\
And in the bad times I fear myself\\
\\
Tell me something, boy\\
Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void?\\
Or do you need more?\\
Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?\\
I'm falling\\
In all the good times I find myself\\
Longing for a change\\
And in the bad times I fear myself\\
\\
\ch{Ami}I'm off the deep end, \ch{D}watch as I dive in\\
\ch{G}I'll never \ch{D}meet the \ch{Emi}ground\\
Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us\\
We're far from the shallow now\\
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low\\
In the sha-sha-la-la-la-low\\
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low\\
We're far from the shallow now\\
\\
\ch{Hmi}Oh, \ch{D}oh, \ch{A}oh, \ch{Emi}oh, \ch{Hmi}oh, \ch{D}oh, \ch{A}oh\\
\\
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in\\
I'll never meet the ground\\
Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us\\
We're far from the shallow now\\
In the shallow, shallow\\
In the shallow, shallow\\
In the shallow, shallow\\
We're far from the shallow now\\
